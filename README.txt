# HetaChain - A Platform For Smart Economy

Too many blockchain projects build solutions that don’t work, for problems that don’t exist. Through our strategic partners, we created a global network of businesses that were asking for blockchain solutions, and defined a feature set based on their needs. We saw the opportunity to build a blockchain platform with broad applications across government, business, and communities.
